# EchoLock Complete Deployment Guide

This guide covers the full deployment process from API to frontend to production.

## Part 1: API Deployment to Railway

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
```

### Step 2: Initialize Project

```bash
# From project root
railway init
```

### Step 3: Add PostgreSQL Database

```bash
railway add postgresql
```

The database will automatically provision and `DATABASE_URL` will be set.

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Generate secure keys first
node -e "console.log('JWT_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
node -e "console.log('SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Set variables in Railway dashboard or via CLI
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=<your-generated-jwt-secret>
railway variables set SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your-generated-encryption-key>
railway variables set RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key_from_resend_com
railway variables set FROM_EMAIL="EchoLock <noreply@yourdomain.com>"
railway variables set FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
railway variables set CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
railway variables set NOSTR_RELAYS=wss://relay.damus.io,wss://nos.lol,wss://relay.nostr.band
```

### Step 5: Deploy API

```bash
railway up
```

### Step 6: Run Database Migrations

```bash
railway run npm run db:migrate
```

### Step 7: Generate Domain

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Settings â†’ Generate Domain
4. Note your API URL: `https://your-project.up.railway.app`

### Step 8: Test API

```bash
curl https://your-project.up.railway.app/health

# Should return:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "database": "connected",
#   ...
# }
```

## Part 2: Setup Resend for Email

### Step 1: Sign Up

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Free tier: 100 emails/day, 3,000/month

### Step 2: Verify Domain

1. Go to Domains â†’ Add Domain
2. Enter your domain (e.g., `echolock.xyz`)
3. Add DNS records provided:
   - MX records
   - TXT record for SPF
   - TXT record for DKIM
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for verification

### Step 3: Create API Key

1. Go to API Keys â†’ Create API Key
2. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)
3. Add to Railway:
   ```bash
   railway variables set RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key
   ```

## Part 3: Frontend Deployment to Vercel

### Step 1: Prepare Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Step 2: Create `.env.local`

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-project.up.railway.app
```

### Step 3: Test Locally

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3001
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
cd frontend
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# - Project name: echolock-frontend
# - Framework: Next.js
# - Build command: npm run build
# - Output directory: .next
```

### Step 5: Set Production Environment Variables

```bash
# In Vercel dashboard or via CLI
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production
# Enter: https://your-project.up.railway.app
```

### Step 6: Deploy to Production

```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Step 7: Setup Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to Vercel dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., `echolock.xyz`)
3. Add DNS records as instructed
4. Update `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway:
   ```bash
   railway variables set FRONTEND_URL=https://echolock.xyz
   railway variables set CORS_ORIGINS=https://echolock.xyz,https://www.echolock.xyz
   ```

## Part 4: Setup Monitoring

### UptimeRobot (Free Uptime Monitoring)

   railway variables set SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn
   ```
6. Install Sentry in API (optional, for better error tracking):
   ```bash
   npm install @sentry/node
   ```
7. Add to `src/api/server.js`:
   ```javascript
   import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

   if (process.env.SENTRY_DSN) {
     Sentry.init({ dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN });
   }
   ```
8. Repeat for frontend with Next.js Sentry package

## Part 6: OpenSats Pitch Preparation

### Create Pitch Deck

Create `docs/OPENSATS-PITCH.md`:

```markdown
# EchoLock - OpenSats Grant Proposal

## Project Overview

**Name**: EchoLock
**Category**: Privacy & Security Tools
**Funding Request**: $50,000
**Duration**: 6 months

## Problem

What happens to your Bitcoin when you die? Your passwords? Your encrypted data?

Current solutions:
- Centralized services (can be shut down, hacked, or censored)
- Manual solutions (unreliable, require trust)
- No cryptographic guarantees

## Solution

EchoLock: A cryptographic dead man's switch using:
- **Bitcoin timelocks** for provable time-based triggers
- **Shamir Secret Sharing** for secure fragment distribution
- **Nostr protocol** for censorship-resistant delivery

## Why Bitcoin Matters Here

1. **OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY**: Cryptographic proof of time passage
2. **Decentralized**: No single point of failure
3. **Immutable**: Timelock guarantees can't be tampered with
4. **Self-custodial**: Users control their secrets

## Technical Innovation

1. **Two-Phase Commitment Protocol**:
   - Preparation transaction (pre-signed, time-locked)
   - Release transaction (broadcast when timer expires)
   - No third-party custody required

2. **Hybrid Architecture**:
   - Bitcoin for time-locking and proof
   - Nostr for fragment distribution
   - End-to-end encryption throughout

3. **Production-Ready**:
   - Comprehensive test suite (>75% coverage)
   - Security audits completed
   - Production deployment guide
   - API and frontend built

## Current Status

**Completed**:
- âœ… Core cryptographic engine

- âœ… Database schema and migrations
- âœ… Frontend dashboard (React/Next.js)
- âœ… Email notification system
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite
- âœ… Security documentation
- âœ… Deployment infrastructure

**In Progress**:
- ðŸ”„ Beta testing with 10-20 users
- ðŸ”„ Frontend refinements
- ðŸ”„ Documentation improvements

**Planned (with funding)**:
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Hardware wallet integration
- Multi-signature support
- Advanced time-lock patterns

### Create Demo Video Script

Create `docs/DEMO-VIDEO-SCRIPT.md`:

```markdown
# EchoLock Demo Video Script (3-5 minutes)

## Opening (0:00-0:30)

[Screen: EchoLock logo animation]

"What happens to your Bitcoin when you die? Your passwords? Your encrypted data?

Today, I'll show you EchoLock - a cryptographic dead man's switch that solves this problem using Bitcoin timelocks and the Nostr protocol."

## Problem Statement (0:30-1:00)

[Screen: Show problem scenarios]

"Current solutions have major flaws:
- Centralized services can be shut down or hacked
- Manual solutions require trusting someone
- No cryptographic guarantees

We need something better."

## Solution Overview (1:00-1:30)

[Screen: Architecture diagram]

"EchoLock combines:
- Bitcoin's OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY for provable time-based triggers
- Shamir Secret Sharing for secure fragment distribution
- Nostr protocol for censorship-resistant delivery

Let me show you how it works."

## Demo: Creating a Switch (1:30-2:30)

[Screen recording: Dashboard]

"First, I'll create a new dead man's switch.

1. I write my secret message - this could be Bitcoin seed phrases, passwords, or instructions
2. I set my check-in interval - let's say 7 days
3. I add recipients who will receive the message if I don't check in
4. I encrypt it with a password

Behind the scenes:
- The message is encrypted with AES-256
- It's split into fragments using Shamir Secret Sharing
- Fragments are distributed across multiple Nostr relays
- A Bitcoin timelock transaction is created but not broadcast"

## Demo: Check-In Process (2:30-3:00)

[Screen recording: Dashboard]

"Now I just need to check in regularly.

I simply click 'Check In' before my timer expires. This resets the countdown.

If I miss a check-in? The system automatically:
1. Broadcasts the timelock transaction
2. Waits for confirmation
3. Retrieves fragments from Nostr
4. Reconstructs the message
5. Sends it to my recipients"

## Technical Highlights (3:00-3:45)

[Screen: Code snippets and diagrams]

"What makes this secure?

1. **No Trust Required**: Everything is cryptographically guaranteed
2. **Decentralized**: No single point of failure
3. **Self-Custodial**: You control your secrets
4. **Open Source**: Fully auditable code

The Bitcoin timelock ensures messages can only be released after a specific time, and Nostr ensures the fragments can't be censored."

## Closing (3:45-4:15)
