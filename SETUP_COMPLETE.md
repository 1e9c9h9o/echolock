## Security Validations

### Cryptographic Library Audit Status
**shamir-secret-sharing@0.0.4:**
- Audit 1: [Cure53](https://cure53.de/audit-report_privy-sss-library.pdf)
- Audit 2: [Zellic](https://github.com/Zellic/publications/blob/master/Privy_Shamir_Secret_Sharing_-_Zellic_Audit_Report.pdf)
- Features: Zero dependencies, constant-time algorithms, zero-share attack mitigation
- Integration: ✓ Verified working in tests

### Security Boundaries Verified
- ✓ Crypto module isolation (no network access)
- ✓ Bitcoin testnet enforcement
- ✓ Nostr relay redundancy (7+ relays)
- ✓ Strict mode on all source files
- ✓ Sensitive file gitignore protection

### Configuration Safety
- ✓ Testnet-only validated in code
- ✓ Mainnet attempts blocked by config module
- ✓ Insufficient relay count rejected
- ✓ Invalid URLs rejected

## Next Steps

### For Development:
1. Implement crypto wrapper functions (see TODOs in code)
2. Implement Bitcoin timelock scripts
3. Implement Nostr multi-relay client
4. Build coordinator orchestration
5. Create CLI commands

### Before Production:
- [ ] Complete all module implementations
- [ ] Achieve 100% test coverage for crypto module
- [ ] Professional security audit (required)
- [ ] Testnet testing with real Bitcoin testnet
- [ ] Nostr relay testing with production relays
- [ ] Comprehensive integration testing
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Code review by security experts

## Important Reminders

⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE**
- This is a proof-of-concept dead man's switch
- DO NOT use for actual sensitive data
- Testnet only until professional audit completed
- No warranty or guarantees provided

⚠️ **CRYPTOGRAPHIC SOFTWARE**
- Mistakes can result in permanent data loss
- Mistakes can result in premature disclosure
- Professional security audit required before production
- User's life or freedom may depend on this working correctly

⚠️ **DEVELOPMENT STATUS**
- Core functionality not yet implemented
- Only infrastructure and tests complete
- Bitcoin operations: testnet only
- Not production ready
