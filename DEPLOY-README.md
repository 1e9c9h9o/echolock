# üöÄ EchoLock Backend Deployment - Quick Start

Your frontend is live at **https://www.echolock.xyz**, but the backend API needs to be deployed.

---

## ‚ö° One-Command Deploy (Easiest)

```bash
./deploy-production.sh
```

This script will:
1. ‚úÖ Check Railway CLI installation
2. ‚úÖ Authenticate with Railway
3. ‚úÖ Create/link Railway project
4. ‚úÖ Add PostgreSQL database
5. ‚úÖ Set all environment variables
6. ‚úÖ Deploy your API
7. ‚úÖ Run database migrations
8. ‚úÖ Seed demo user
9. ‚úÖ Show you your API URL

**After deployment**, you just need to:
- Get a Resend API key (for emails): https://resend.com
- Configure DNS (5 minutes): See `DNS-SETUP-GUIDE.md`

## üìã Quick Checklist

**Before Deployment:**
- [ ] Have a Railway or Render account
- [ ] Know where your domain `echolock.xyz` is managed (Cloudflare, Namecheap, etc.)

**Run Deployment:**
- [ ] Run `./deploy-production.sh`
- [ ] Get Resend API key from https://resend.com
- [ ] Set it: `railway variables set RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxx"`

**After Deployment:**
- [ ] Note your Railway URL (e.g., `echolock-api-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`)
- [ ] Add DNS CNAME record: `api` ‚Üí Your Railway URL
- [ ] Wait 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation
- [ ] Test: `curl https://api.echolock.xyz/health`
- [ ] Test login at https://www.echolock.xyz/auth/login

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Test Railway Direct URL
```bash
curl https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/health
```

### 2. Test Custom Domain (after DNS)
```bash
curl https://api.echolock.xyz/health
```

### 3. Test Login API
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.echolock.xyz/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"demo@echolock.xyz","password":"DemoPass123"}'
```

### 4. Test Frontend Login
1. Go to https://www.echolock.xyz/auth/login
2. Login with:
   - Email: demo@echolock.xyz
   - Password: DemoPass123
3. Should redirect to dashboard

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to redeploy the frontend?**
A: No! The frontend is already configured to use `api.echolock.xyz`

**Q: How long does deployment take?**
A: 5-10 minutes for deployment + 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation

**Q: What if I don't have a Resend API key?**
A: The app will work, but email features (verification, password reset) won't work

**Q: Can I use a different domain?**
A: Yes! Update `FRONTEND_URL` and `CORS_ORIGINS` in `.env.production`

**Q: Is HTTPS automatic?**
A: Yes! Both Railway and Render provide free SSL certificates

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**"railway: command not found"**
‚Üí Run: `npm install -g @railway/cli`

**"Unauthorized. Please login"**
‚Üí Run: `railway login`

**"DNS not resolving"**
‚Üí Wait longer, check DNS with: https://dnschecker.org/#CNAME/api.echolock.xyz

**"Login failed"**
‚Üí Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
‚Üí Verify database migrations ran: `railway run npm run db:migrate`

**"CORS error"**
‚Üí Check CORS_ORIGINS includes your frontend domain
