# ECHOLOCK Threat Model

## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.1.0
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-02
- **Status**: Development - Pre-Audit
- **Scope**: ECHOLOCK v0.1.0 cryptographic dead man's switch system

## Executive Summary

ECHOLOCK is a cryptographic dead man's switch that combines Bitcoin timelocks with Nostr-based distributed storage and Shamir Secret Sharing. The system is designed to automatically release encrypted secrets after a specified timelock expires, unless the user performs regular check-ins. This threat model identifies security risks across cryptographic, network, operational, and adversarial dimensions.

**Critical Risk Areas:**
1. Cryptographic implementation errors (premature disclosure or permanent loss)
2. Timelock misconfiguration (incorrect release timing)
3. Insufficient relay redundancy (data availability failure)
4. Key management vulnerabilities (unauthorized access)

---

## Assets

### 1. **User Secret** (Critical)
- The sensitive data being protected (e.g., passwords, keys, personal information)
- **Confidentiality Impact**: HIGH - Unauthorized disclosure could endanger user
- **Integrity Impact**: MEDIUM - Corruption leads to loss of data
- **Availability Impact**: HIGH - Loss means permanent data unavailability

### 2. **Secret Shares** (Critical)
- Shamir Secret Sharing fragments (5 fragments, 3-of-5 threshold)
- Distributed across 7+ Nostr relays
- **Threat**: If ≥3 shares are compromised, secret can be reconstructed prematurely
- **Threat**: If <3 shares remain available, secret is permanently lost

### 3. **Private Keys** (Critical)
- **Bitcoin Private Key**: Controls timelock transactions and funds
- **Nostr Private Key**: Signs fragment events for authentication
- **Encryption Key**: AES-256-GCM key derived from master secret
- **Threat**: Private key compromise enables unauthorized operations

### 4. **Timelock State** (High)
- Current check-in timestamp and expiry time
- Bitcoin transaction locktime configuration
- **Threat**: State manipulation could trigger premature or delayed release

### 5. **System Configuration** (Medium)
- Relay list, threshold parameters, fee settings
- **Threat**: Misconfiguration could render system inoperable

### 6. **Local Storage Data** (Medium)
- Switch metadata, encrypted parameters (not secrets)
- **Threat**: Information disclosure about system usage
