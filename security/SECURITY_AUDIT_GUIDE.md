## Executive Summary

ECHOLOCK is a cryptographic dead man's switch that combines Bitcoin timelocks, Nostr-based distributed storage, and Shamir Secret Sharing to automatically release secrets after a specified timelock expires. **This document outlines requirements for a professional security audit before production deployment.**

**Current Status**: v0.1.0 - Feature-complete, testnet operational, awaiting security audit

**Critical Requirement**: This software handles sensitive user secrets and cryptographic operations. A professional security audit by a qualified firm is **mandatory** before any production use.
