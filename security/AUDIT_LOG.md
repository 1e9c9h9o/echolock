*No external security audits completed yet*

**Required before production:**
- [ ] Cryptographic implementation review
- [ ] Bitcoin timelock verification
- [ ] Nostr protocol security assessment
- [ ] Dependency security audit
- [ ] Penetration testing

## Internal Security Reviews

### 2025-09-29: Initial Project Structure
**Reviewer**: Internal
**Scope**: Project initialization, security boundaries defined
**Findings**:
- Project structure established with security isolation
- Cryptographic modules marked as isolated (no network access)
- Bitcoin operations configured for testnet only
- Nostr redundancy requirements documented (minimum 7 relays)

**Actions Taken**:
- Created security-first folder structure
- Documented threat model
- Established testing requirements (100% coverage for crypto)
- Added security warnings to all user-facing documentation

**Status**: Structure complete, implementation pending

### 2025-09-29: Dependencies Installation and Testing
**Reviewer**: Internal
**Scope**: Security-audited dependencies installation and test suite
**Findings**:
- Successfully installed `shamir-secret-sharing@0.0.4` (Privy, audited by Cure53 and Zellic)
  - NOTE: Package name is `shamir-secret-sharing`, not `@privy-io/shamir-secret-sharing`
  - Confirmed working via integration tests
  - Library uses async API with Uint8Array inputs
- Installed `bitcoinjs-lib@6.1.7` for Bitcoin operations
- Installed `nostr-tools@2.17.0` for Nostr protocol
- Installed `dotenv@17.2.3` for configuration management
- Installed `jest@30.2.0` for testing framework

**Test Results**:
- 41/41 tests passing (100%)
- Comprehensive crypto module tests (encryption, key derivation, Shamir SSS)
- Project structure validation tests
- Security boundary verification tests
- All modules import successfully
- Testnet-only enforcement verified

**Security Validation**:
- ✓ All crypto modules have security boundary documentation
- ✓ All 11 source files use strict mode
- ✓ Bitcoin network locked to testnet
- ✓ Minimum 7 relay redundancy configured
- ✓ Gitignore protects sensitive files (.env, *.key, *.secret)
- ✓ Node.js >= 18.0.0 requirement met

**Status**: Development environment ready, all tests passing

## Dependencies Security

### Installed Dependencies (as of 2025-09-29)

**Production Dependencies**:
- `shamir-secret-sharing@0.0.4` - Independently audited by Cure53 and Zellic
  - Zero dependencies
  - TypeScript implementation
  - Published by Privy (andrew.macpherson-admin@privy.io)
  - [Cure53 Audit Report](https://cure53.de/audit-report_privy-sss-library.pdf)
  - [Zellic Audit Report](https://github.com/Zellic/publications/blob/master/Privy_Shamir_Secret_Sharing_-_Zellic_Audit_Report.pdf)
- `bitcoinjs-lib@6.1.7` - Industry standard Bitcoin library
  - Widely used and audited
  - Maintained by bitcoinjs organization
- `nostr-tools@2.17.0` - Nostr protocol implementation
  - Community-maintained
  - Standard library for Nostr
- `dotenv@17.2.3` - Environment variable management
  - Minimal, well-established utility

**Development Dependencies**:
- `jest@30.2.0` - Testing framework

**Dependency Audit Notes**:
- Initial attempt to install `@privy-io/shamir-secret-sharing` failed (package doesn't exist)
- Correct package name is `shamir-secret-sharing` (no scope)
- All dependencies installed without vulnerabilities (npm audit clean)

**Dependency Policy**:
- Minimize third-party dependencies
- Use only well-audited cryptographic libraries
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Pin exact versions in production
