# ECHOLOCK Incident Response Plan

## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-12
- **Status**: Active (Pre-Production)
- **Review Cycle**: Quarterly
- **Owner**: Security Team

## Overview

This document outlines the incident response procedures for ECHOLOCK security incidents. Given that ECHOLOCK is a cryptographic dead man's switch handling sensitive user secrets, rapid and coordinated incident response is critical to prevent:

- **Premature secret disclosure** (confidentiality breach)
- **Permanent data loss** (availability failure)
- **Timelock manipulation** (integrity failure)

---

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Examples | Response Time |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **P0 - CRITICAL** | Active exploitation, data breach | Cryptographic bypass discovered, private keys compromised, secret disclosure | Immediate (< 1 hour) |
| **P1 - HIGH** | High-risk vulnerability, no active exploit | Timelock manipulation possible, relay compromise, key generation weakness | < 4 hours |
| **P2 - MEDIUM** | Security issue with workaround | DoS vulnerability, configuration weakness, non-critical logic error | < 24 hours |
| **P3 - LOW** | Minor security concern | Information disclosure, dependency with low CVSS | < 7 days |

### Incident Types

1. **Cryptographic Failures**
   - Weak key generation
   - Shamir Secret Sharing bypass
   - AES-GCM authentication bypass
   - Insufficient entropy

2. **Timelock Manipulation**

## Incident Response Playbooks

### Playbook 1: Cryptographic Vulnerability

**Scenario**: Weakness discovered in encryption, secret sharing, or key derivation

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Confirm vulnerability with reproduction
2. Assess if secrets can be reconstructed prematurely
3. Notify users to avoid creating new switches
4. Identify affected switches (version, configuration)

**Technical Response:**
1. Review cryptographic implementation
2. Consult with cryptography experts
3. Replace vulnerable component with secure alternative
4. Verify fix with property-based tests
5. Consider switch rotation for affected users

**User Guidance:**
- Stop using affected versions immediately
- Do not create new switches until patched
- Existing switches: [Impact assessment specific to vulnerability]

### Playbook 2: Timelock Bypass

**Scenario**: Method discovered to release secrets before timelock expiration

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Confirm attack vector (Bitcoin MTP manipulation? Local time bypass?)
2. Assess feasibility (theoretical vs. practical)
3. Notify users of risk
4. Disable check-in functionality if necessary

**Technical Response:**
1. Review timelock implementation
2. Add additional safety margins
3. Consider block-height-only timelocks
4. Implement monitoring for suspicious activity

**User Guidance:**
- Extend check-in intervals as safety measure

- Consider creating new switches with fixed version

### Playbook 3: Nostr Relay Compromise

**Scenario**: Adversary controls multiple relays or Sybil attack detected

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Identify compromised relays
2. Remove from default relay list
3. Notify users to avoid compromised relays
4. Assess if threshold shares were collected

**Technical Response:**

2. Add geographic/operator diversity checks
3. Increase minimum relay count requirement
4. Consider alternative distribution mechanisms

**User Guidance:**
- Review your relay configuration
- Recreate switches with new relay set if concerned
- Enable additional relay redundancy

### Playbook 4: Dependency Vulnerability

**Scenario**: Vulnerability discovered in third-party dependency

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Identify affected dependency and versions
