## Known Vulnerabilities

### 1. Implementation Incomplete
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Status**: OPEN
**Description**: Core cryptographic and network functionality not yet implemented.

**Affected Components**: All modules
**Mitigation**: None - software is not functional yet
**Timeline**: Target Q1 2026 for initial implementation

---

### 2. Bitcoin Median Time Past (MTP) Uncertainty
**Severity**: HIGH
**Status**: ACKNOWLEDGED
**Description**: Bitcoin's median time past calculation can lag real time by up to ~2 hours, causing unpredictable timelock activation.

**Affected Components**: `src/bitcoin/timelockScript.js`
**Mitigation**:
- Build 2-hour safety margin into timelock calculations
- User education about timelock uncertainty windows
- Consider additional block-height-based timelocks

**Timeline**: Inherent to Bitcoin protocol, cannot be fully resolved

---

### 3. Nostr Relay Persistence
**Severity**: HIGH
**Status**: ACKNOWLEDGED
**Description**: Nostr relays provide no persistence guarantees. Data may be deleted at any time.

**Affected Components**: `src/nostr/multiRelayClient.js`
**Mitigation**:
- Require minimum 7 relay redundancy per fragment
- Regular health checks and data verification
- Consider periodic re-broadcasting of fragments
- User education about relay reliability

**Timeline**: Inherent to Nostr protocol, requires operational procedures

---

### 4. Shamir Zero-Share Attacks
**Severity**: HIGH
**Status**: MITIGATED
**Description**: Some Shamir implementations vulnerable to attacks when adversary contributes zero-value shares.

**Affected Components**: `src/crypto/secretSharing.js`
**Mitigation**: Use @privy-io/shamir-secret-sharing (audited by Cure53, includes zero-share protections)
**Timeline**: Resolved by library choice

---

### 5. No Quantum Resistance
**Severity**: MEDIUM (future threat)
**Status**: ACKNOWLEDGED
**Description**: Bitcoin ECDSA and current encryption schemes vulnerable to quantum computing attacks.

**Affected Components**: All cryptographic components
**Mitigation**:
- Monitor post-quantum cryptography developments
- Plan migration to quantum-resistant algorithms
- Consider this a 10+ year timeline threat

**Timeline**: Post-quantum migration planned for future major version

---

### 6. Fee Market Volatility
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Status**: ACKNOWLEDGED
**Description**: Extreme Bitcoin fee spikes could prevent timelock transactions from confirming.

**Affected Components**: `src/bitcoin/feeEstimation.js`
**Mitigation**:
- Dynamic fee estimation with multiple data sources
- Fallback fee rates
- User education about fee requirements
- Consider Lightning Network for future versions

**Timeline**: Mitigation implementation in development phase

---

### 7. Single Point of Failure: User Device
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Status**: ACKNOWLEDGED
**Description**: User's device/credentials are single point of failure for check-ins.

**Affected Components**: Authentication system (not yet implemented)
**Mitigation**:
- Multiple authentication methods (future)
- Backup check-in mechanisms (future)
- Clear user documentation about device security

**Timeline**: Future enhancement

---

### 8. No Key Rotation
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Status**: ACKNOWLEDGED
**Description**: Initial implementation will not support key rotation for existing setups.

**Affected Components**: All key management
**Mitigation**:
- Document manual key rotation procedures
- Plan key rotation feature for v2.0

**Timeline**: Future enhancement

---

### 9. Dependency Vulnerabilities
**Severity**: VARIABLE
**Status**: ONGOING
**Description**: Third-party dependencies may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities.

**Affected Components**: All dependencies
**Mitigation**:
- Minimize dependencies
- Use well-audited libraries only
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning

**Timeline**: Continuous monitoring required

---

### 10. Side-Channel Attacks
**Severity**: LOW-MEDIUM
**Status**: ACKNOWLEDGED
**Description**: Timing attacks and other side channels not fully mitigated.

**Affected Components**: Cryptographic operations
**Mitigation**:
- Use constant-time operations where available
- Limit cryptographic operations on untrusted devices
- Future: Add side-channel protections

**Timeline**: Enhanced protections in future versions

---

## Limitations (By Design)

### Network Requirements
- Requires Bitcoin network access (testnet or mainnet)
- Requires connection to multiple Nostr relays
- No offline mode for initial setup or check-ins

### Timelock Constraints
- Minimum 24-hour future timelock
- ~2 hour uncertainty window due to Bitcoin MTP
- Cannot be shortened once set (blockchain immutable)

### Recovery Limitations
- Recovery only possible after timelock expiration
- Cannot recover if insufficient relay redundancy achieved
- No emergency override mechanism (by design)

## Reporting New Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Contact project maintainers privately
3. Provide detailed description and reproduction steps
4. Allow reasonable time for fix before public disclosure

**Responsible disclosure timeline**: 90 days
